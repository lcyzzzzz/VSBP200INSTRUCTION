### 1.2 Applications
THE VSBP200/300/350 dry pumping systems are suitable for applications with vapor condensation.We have a
 dedicated team of applications engineers who can help to determine the best dry pumping system for 
an application

VSBP200/300/350干泵机组应用广泛。应用工程师将提供专业的工况应用建议。

Warranties may be invalidated if the dry pumping system is used on an unsuitable application.If in 
doubt,contact us.

因为工况问题造成损坏，不计入保修。

### 1.3 Description 简述
The dry pumping system has been developed to meet the demanding requirements for process pumping 
solutions in vapor condensation applications. The vacuum system sets new standards for vapor capability, reliability 
and reduced cost of ownership in low footprint packages.

VSBP200/300/350机组适用于抽除可凝性气体，极大提高水蒸气抽除效率和能力。占地面积也相对较小。

The VSBP vacuum systems range provides a ideal replacement for scroll,oil-sealed and multi-stage Roots pumps.
VSBP机组可完全替代涡旋泵、油封泵和多级罗茨。

especially in frequently evacuating small vacuum chamber.
特别适合小腔体，快节拍的工况。

Bullt-in Frequency converter has remote operation mode (RS-485, dry contacts), multiple rotational speed 
selection (power saving, noise reduction, adaptation to application cycle)
内置变频器提供通讯控制接口（RS-485，干式节点），多档转速（节能、降噪、多工况匹配）
